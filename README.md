# sensor_fault-tolerant_distributed_observer_design
This repository includes simulation codes that are used for the Automatica paper "Sensor Fault-Tolerant State Estimation by Networks of Distributed Observers".
run "sensor_robust_sixnode_allunobservable" first to load the parameters. Then, choose the target Simulink files to conduct the simulation.
Please install CVX for solving the LMIs, and remember to add all .m files to the path.
